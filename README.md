# Snowflake - One data platform for your Enterprise

### Introduction

By defenition, a Data Lake is a storage repository that should store infinite amount of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

Snowflake with its unique architecture of leveraging any cloud (AWS, GCS, Azure) blob storage as its STORAGE layer is a perfect fit for the definition. Adding more to it, Snowflake also encrypts all your data with AES-256 encryption at REST and also applies patented compression on the data ensuring you are paying lower cost of storage compared to the hyper-scalers.

With its unmatched performance and near infinite scalability you can retrieve business value out of your data lake instantly making SNOWFLAKE A PERFECT LAKEHOUSE
